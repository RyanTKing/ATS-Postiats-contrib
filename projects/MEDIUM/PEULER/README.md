# Learning ATS by Solving Math Puzzles

## Project Description

ATS is equipped with a highly expressive type system rooted
in the framework Applied Types System, which also gives the
language its name. It is, however, non-trivial to make effective
use of types in ATS. Many people wanted to learn ATS and made
a great deal of effort to do so but failed at the end.

In the past, I found that solving math puzzles in ATS could be an extremely
effective way to learn dependent types and theorem-proving.  In this
project, I am seeking help from the ats-lang-users community as well as
other people interested in ATS to translate into ATS some of the problems
published at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). The ATS
code translated from the description of a problem is referred to as a
formal specification for the problem. It is my hope that there will be
considerably large interest (generated from the ats-lang-users community
and elsewhere) in implementing the specifications posted here.

I will be eagerly collecting both specifications and their implementations.
Note that a problem may be given multiple specificatons (of varying degree
of accuracy or completeness) and each specification may implemented in many
different styles.
