# Learning Program Verification by Solving Math Puzzles

## Project Description

ATS is equipped with a highly expressive type system rooted
in the framework Applied Types System, which also gives the
language its name. It is, however, non-trivial to make effective
use of types in ATS. Many people wanted to learn ATS and made
a great deal of effort to do so but failed at the end.

In the past, I found that solving math puzzles in ATS could be an extremely
effective way to learn dependent types and theorem-proving.  In this
project, I am seeking help from the ats-lang-users community as well as
other people interested in ATS to translate into ATS some of the problems
published at [https://projecteuler.net](Project Euler).
